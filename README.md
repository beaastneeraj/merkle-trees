Project Name: Encryption using Merkle Trees

Summary:
A hash tree or Merkle tree is a tree of hashes in which the leaves are hashes of data blocks in,
for instance, a file or set of files. Nodes farther up in the tree are the hashes of their respective children.
For example, in the above picture hash 0 is the result of hashing the concatenation of hash 0-0 and hash 0-1.
That is, hash 0 = hash( hash 0-0 + hash 0-1 ) where "+" denotes concatenation.
